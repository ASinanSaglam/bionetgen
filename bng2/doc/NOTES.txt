Release Notes (OBSOLETE)

Current version is 2.0.46 (see http://bionetgen.lanl.gov/BioNetWiki/index.php/Release_Notes)


2.0.41

    * Improved recognition of OS specific binaries using the $Config{myarch} variable in Perl.
    * Fixed model naming in SBML files (path header is removed).

2.0.40

    * Now includes RuleBuilder GUI interface to BioNetGen.
    * Back end executables for Linux, Mac, and Windows also provided in the default distribution. 


2.0.39

    * Fixes small bugs in reading of Expressions from parameter block. 


2.0.38

    * Fixes bug that appeared starting in 2.0.36 that reading of Reactions
from a .NET file was broken. It also marks the first version to use the new
Expression.pm module, which allows the use of simple math expressions in the
parameter block. This version may be somewhat unstable due to incomplete
testing of the Expression.pm and other related changes. --Faeder 21:31, 27

2.0.37

    * Fixes deleteMolecules bug. Also introduces stricter Molecule Type
checking. If the Molecule types block is used, only molecules matching defined
types will be allowed as seed species, in observables, or in reaction
rules. You will also note that Compartments are now defined in the .net
file. There is now a partial implementation of Compartments, but the next
release will fully implement these capabilities, and will be accompanied by
documentation of the new syntax.

2.0.36

    * Fixes Sat/MM bug involving reactions that use MM and Sat RateLaws in
which reactant order was not preserved in the generated reactions.  


2.0.35

    * Fixed the Dimer dissociation bug, which resulted from improper checking
of product connectivity when molecules were deleted in a reaction. The bug
could only arise in a rule in which a molecule is deleted, but it is otherwise
difficult to anticipate. Updating to this version is therefore strongly
recommended.

2.0.34

    * Fixed bug in handling of include/exclude directives that allowed
reactions that should have been excluded. A test input file that demonstrates
the bug is here. 
    * Added a java plotting utility called PhiBPlot for plotting CDAT and GDAT files.
