Installation procedure for Network3:

**Building with Autotools**
---------------------------
If configure script does not exist (developers only):
0) autoreconf --no-recursive --install

To configure compile and install Network3 (all users):
1) ./configure --prefix=BNGPATH --disable-shared
2) make
3) make install

The run_network binary will be placed in BNGPATH/bin/.
Note that BNGPATH must specify the absolute path.

**Building with CMake**
-----------------------
0) Download CMake (http://www.cmake.org/) and add to PATH.
1) cp Makefile.cmake Makefile
2) make

The run_network binary will be placed in ../bin/.

**Validating the BioNetGen installation**
-----------------------------------------
0) If NFsim validation is desired, place NFsim binary (or symbolic link)
   in the folder BNGPATH/bin/.
1) Run the Perl script BNGPATH/Validate/validate_examples.pl.
2) If any tests fail, look at the log files for more information.

PLEASE NOTE: Stochastic simulation tests rely on statistical validation.
Occasionally a validation will fail due to outliers. The current validation
script only reports stochastic validation failures if they occur TWICE in
a row. Therefore, if this occurs there is a good chance that something is
wrong. To confirm, we suggest rerunning the validation at least once.
Single tests may be run by passing the model basename as argument.
