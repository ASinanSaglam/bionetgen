Installation procedure for SBMLParser:

Prerequisites:

SBML2BNGL is a tool written in Python 2.7. The following libraries are needed in order to build the binary from scratch

* numpy 1.8.0 or greater
* scipy  0.12.0 or greater
* libsbml 5.10.0  or greater (http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML), with python bindings (can be installed using "pip install python-libsbml")
* pandas for BioGrid functionality (http://pandas.pydata.org/)

Building instructions for Linux/MacOSX/Cygwin:

* make
* make install

This will place a binary called sbmlTranslate-${arch} in the bin directory inside the BioNetGen distribution

Troubleshooting:

----- Bootloader related errors

* Prebuilt bootloaders for Windows-cygwin/MacOSX/Linux are included in the BioNetGen  distribution, however in case the building platform is not supported by the bootloaders we have bundled it 
is necessary to create a custom one.
* Go to pyinstaller2/bootloader and execute:

  ./waf configure build install
