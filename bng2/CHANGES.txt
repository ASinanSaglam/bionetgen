== BioNetGen-2.2.4-testing ==
2013 March 30

==== New Features ====

===== Empty species symbol "0" supported for compartmental BNGL =====
We introduced the new symbol "0" in 2.2.3 for representing an empty
pattern or species. This is useful anywhere BNG expects a pattern or
species but the modeler wants the empty set. For example, "0" may be
used on the LHS of a reaction rule for zero-order synthesis, or
the RHS for degradation rules. This feature is now supported in
compartmental BNGL

'''NOTE:''' compartmental BNGL adopts the syntax that zero order synthesis rate
constants are given as intensive units (conc/time or counts/vol/time).
Hence, the total rate of synthesis depends on the rate constant AND
the volume of the compartment.

===== Energy BNGL (testing) =====
Energy modeling is a new approach to rule-based modeling where
kinetics are derived from changes in free-energy and activation barriers.
This approach was pioneered by J. Ollivier, et al. (PLoS Comp. Bio. 2010)
and generalized by Vincent Danos. Energy modeling has a number of advantages,
including: detailed balance is guaranteed, reaction rules are simplified,
and allostery/cooperativity easily implemented. Keep an eye out for more
documentation and examples of energy modeling in BNG.

===== Time-dependent functions (testing) =====
Implemented a special function "time()" that refers to the current time 
in a simulation. The time function may be used
in any mathemetical expression. This is useful for ratelaws or
events that depend on time. Time is recognized by run_network but
not (presently) by NFsim.

'''CAUTION:''' Discontinuities in ratelaws may cause problems for
ODE integrators. If a timed event causes a discrete change
in a ratelaw, it is best to stop and continue the simulation.

'''CAUTION:''' Time-dependent rates in SSA simulations may introduce
substantial error if the relative rate change is fast in time. Advanced
methods exist for managing time-dependent rates accurately; however,
these methods are not currently implemented in run_network. The

===== molecule-scoped local functions =====
Added support for local functions evaluated on the scope of a tagged
molecule. This feature was already supported by NFsim, but is now
available for network generation and network simulation. See the NFsim
manual (chapter 7) for examples of moelcule-scoped local functions.

==== Improvements to Existing Features ====

===== on-the-fly network generation is fixed =====
Run_network supports on-the-fly network generation again. However, the
implementation is not very efficient. For most applicables, NFsim is
recommended for applications with large networks.

===== Added support for functional rate laws in SBML export =====
Fixed SBML export for functional rate laws. Global functions are now
output in the same way as parameter expressions. Local functions are NOT
output to SBML because they are evaluated down to a number by BNG during
network generation so they're unnecessary. Note that the "Group_" prefix
has been removed from the SBML IDs of observables so that they can be
easily referenced in function expressions. This is not a problem because
parameters and observables occupy the same namespace so there's no
possibility of conflicts.

===== Better handling of mathematical expression in output =====
BioNetGen now exports mathematical expressions by default, rather than evaluating
to a number. This preserves the original math when models or networks are written 
to file. Support for mathematical expressions in the parameters block was added
to run_network.

===== Upgrades to MATLAB export via writeMfile() =====
* Improved error capture when calling MATLAB's ODE23s integrator.
* Support for "if" functions: "if(cond,val1,val2)" is translated
to "(cond~=0)*val1 + (cond==1)*val2". This isn't a perfect solution since it
requires that val1 and val2 both evaluate to finite numbers. Unfortunately,
MATLAB does not support the ternary conditional (a better solution).
* Eliminated redundancy of expression evaluation, resulting in better 
run-time efficiency.

==== Bug Fixes ====
* Fixed bug where parameters beginning with "and" or "or" were confused
with the logical operations. The problem was traced to the muParser
library. Upgrading to muParser v2.2.3 solved this problem.
* Fixed bug where setConcentration (and potentially other actions) fail to parse
arguments that contain species definitions with compartmental syntax.
* Fixed bug in BNG math expression parser where unary operators were parsed
incorrectly in some circumstances.
* Fixed bug where run_network reported incorrect line number in error message.
* Fixed potential bug in isomorphic detection method, where BNG attempts to
access undefined nodes if graphs have unequal size. This is prevented by
checking the size of the graphs prior to comparison.
* Fixed bug that caused generate_network() action to return an error if no
seed species are defined. This fix permits network generation for models with
0-order synthesis but no seed species.
* Fixed bug where scan_var.pl generated invalid scripts if the BNGL model file
does not end with a new line.

==== Minor Syntax Changes ====
* Deprecated use of fixed quantity flag "$"  within reactant rules.
The fixed quantity flag should only be used in the seed species block.
* Use of "fake" species such as "NULL", "TRASH", or "SINK" as placeholders
in reaction rules with zero reactants and products is now deprecated.
We advise the use of the special symbol "0" instead.
* Labels are now permitted before definitions in all BNGL blocks.

==== Changes to BNG action commands ====
* Added 'continue' option to generate_network() action. If this option
is enabled, BNG will continue generating a network from the last
completed iteration. If disabled, BNG will start reset the network
and generate from scratch. The option is enabled by default, i.e.'continue=>1'.
* Complex bookkeeping option, 'complex', is now enabled by default in the
simulate_nf() action, i.e. 'complex=>1'.
* The 'exact' option for generate_hybrid_model() was renamed to 'safe'. This
avoids confusion over whether the standard method is exact. Indeed, both
methods are exact if population lumping is instantaneous. However, only
the 'safe' method is exact for finite lumping rates. The default is
'safe=>0'. The old 'exact' option will be supported up to (and including) the
next stable release.

==== Error and Warning Message Changes ====
* Useless {MatchOnce} attribute in species definitions are now detected and
reported.
* Improved detection of illegal dangling bonds and wildcards in reaction rules.
* Improved clarity of error messages for unrecognized BNG version strings
and missing ratelaw arguments.
* scan_var.pl utility reports an error is the BNGL model does not contain an
"end model" directive.
* run_network will now allow commented lines in the functions block of the
NET file.
* run_network no longer complains is there are no parameters in the model.

==== New Example and Validation Models ====
* Added gene_expr_func.bngl and localfunc.bngl to Models2 directory.
NOTE: these models were previous distributed as validation models.
* Adding two new validation files: (1) isingspin_energy.bngl implements an ising
spin model on a 3x3 toroidal lattice using the energy approach, (2)
isingspin_localfcn.bngl implements the ising spin model (same topology) using
local functions. Both models test the SSA equillibrium distribution. Model 2
also tests the NF equillibrium distribution.  NOTE: the energy approach is
not supported in NFsim, hence this version won't scale to a larger lattice.

==== Code refactoring ====
* Enabled strict and warning pragmas in BNGModel.pm
* Migrated to muParser 2.2.3 (from v134) for parsing math expressions in
run_network.I mplemented a static "If()" function in network.h that gets
called as "if()" in muParser [parser.DefineFun("if",If) in
network::read_functions_array()]. This should solve the problem of if()
being deprecated in the muparser_v2_2_3. Also modified run_network.cpp and
network.cpp to no longer replace "&&" with "and" and "||" with "or".
* Reformulated generate_network so that observables and energy patterns are
updated as species are generated, rather than after an iteration of
network generation completes.
* The Expression type "FUN" was renamed as "FunctionCall". The original type
name caused some confusion as to whether the expression was a function
definition or a function call. To clarify, the type was renamed FunctionCall.
The Function object holds the definition (RHS) for a function. For further
reference: the Param type Function associates a name to a Function object.
A function without an associated Param is anonymous (i.e. cannot be found in
the ParamList).
